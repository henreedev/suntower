# Suntower

## Project Overview

**Game Title**: _Brief description of the game (genre, key mechanics, unique features)._

**Engine and Tools**: Built in Godot. _Mention any other tools/libraries you used._

**Objective**: Main goals and achievements of the project (e.g., "Demonstrates complex AI for enemies," "Focuses on polished user interface and interactions").

## Setup and Installation

- **How to Play**: Visit the [itch.io page](https://henree.itch.io/suntower) to install the game as a zip. Unzip and play the game's `.exe` file.

## Scripts Overview

**Main Scripts**: List each primary script with a short description of its purpose.

- **Example**:
  - **PlayerController.gd**: Manages player movement, input, and core mechanics like jumping and shooting.
  - **EnemyAI.gd**: Governs enemy behavior, pathfinding, and interactions with the player.
  - **GameManager.gd**: Controls game flow, levels, and score tracking.
  - **UIManager.gd**: Handles all HUD elements and displays health, score, and messages.

## Detailed Explanation of Key Scripts

### Key Script Example - `PlayerController.gd`

- **Purpose**: Handles all player-related actions and interactions.
- **Main Functions**:
  - `move_player()`: Manages player movement based on user input.
  - `shoot_projectile()`: Creates and fires projectiles when the player presses the shoot button.
  - `take_damage(amount)`: Reduces health based on the damage amount and triggers game over if health is depleted.
- **Special Logic**: Briefly mention any unique code you’re proud of or that shows problem-solving skills.

## Algorithms and Important Concepts

Highlight any complex or particularly interesting sections of code:

- **Pathfinding Logic**: _Describe any notable AI pathfinding algorithm or complex movement patterns._
- **Procedural Generation**: _Describe how procedural generation is implemented, if applicable._
- **Optimization Techniques**: _Mention any optimizations for performance, such as pooling objects or reducing draw calls._

## Known Limitations or Future Improvements

Briefly mention any limitations you’re aware of or improvements you’d make with more time. This can show that you recognize areas for growth, even if you didn’t have time to address them.
